# Advent of Code — Rust Solutions

A collection of my attempts at **Advent of Code**, implemented in **Rust**.

## Goals

* Practice Rust, as mainly i use C
* Write clean and idiomatic Rust.
* Try and use Rust libraries instead of hand-writing loops
* Keep each solution small, readable, and well‑structured.

## Structure

Each day lives in its own cargo module under `day_<X>/src/`
They are grouped under Cargo.toml
Any input for the day is in `day_<x>/input`, including my testing set

## Running

```bash
cargo run --bin day_1
```
